# Simple Neural Network on Iris Dataset

A simple feedforward neural network implemented **from scratch in Python/NumPy**, trained to perform **binary classification** on the Iris dataset.

This project is a hands-on demonstration of building, training, and evaluating a small neural network without using any deep learning libraries (like TensorFlow or PyTorch).

## 🌟 Features

✅ Built entirely using Python and NumPy  
✅ Supports binary classification  
✅ Uses a single hidden layer with ReLU activation and sigmoid output  
✅ Trained with gradient descent  
✅ Works on the Iris dataset from scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset

The network is tested on the classic [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), focusing on distinguishing **class 0 (Setosa) vs. other classes**.
